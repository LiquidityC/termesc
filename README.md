## Term ESC

A library/wrapper to ease the process of creating a nice TUI using ansi escape sequences.

### Idea
This library is aimed to be easy to use and non intrusive in your project. It should take care of basic setup and
shutdown of your alternate terminal buffer and help you write in a specified place without having to read the entire 
book on ansi escape sequences.
